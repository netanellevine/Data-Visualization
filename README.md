# Data-Visualization

1. The first notebook's goal was to improve our classification notebook from last semester by using new models and techniques we learned this semester.

2. In the second notebook we created a dataset from clothes images and our goal was to find the best way to recognize for each image the right clothing.

3. In the third notebook we created a dataset from cats and dogs images and we try to find the best way to recognize for each image the right answer.

To achieve our goals in the three above missions, we used the models we learned in class : KNN , Random Forest, XGBoost, AdaBoost ,  Voting(soft and hard) , Bagging,  Stacking, K-Means , Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes.

4. In the fourth and last notebook we get drawing of kids and by understanding the data with the help of Pandas our goal was to answer the following questions:
  a. How many different lines this drawing contains? 
  b. What is the average pressure and the length(euclidean distance) of each line?
  c. How many times the kid who drew this doodle raised his hand during the doodling?
  d. Does this shape open or close?
